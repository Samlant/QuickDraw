**QuickDraw is a program that utilizes Microsoft's Graph API for:**

- reading/writing files (including a report tracker)
- sending emails through Outlook

## Base Concept

Recall a time that you just got off the phone with a client after taking their information and you were immediately interrupted with another phone call, only soon to find yourself distracted long enough to miss a step in your refined routine...

    ie. making an entry to keep track of them and their quotes

... so the new client remains in the shadows long enough to eventually create a panic situation...

1.  This will **watch a specified folder** for any new, **saved quoteforms**;
    - **can be customized to any folder** or set of folders (just let me know);
2.  creates a custom/complete folder hierarchy for the client;
3.  Client details are **prefilled automatically** and used throughout the program, which removes much of the manual effort from your end;
4.  Do you already know which markets are a good fit for this client? **Allocate markets** and **this will include those markets within your tracker**;
5.  Ready for submission? This will use a **customizable template to submit your quoteform into nine different programs**;
    - **add any/all attachments** you want by simply **clicking and dragging the files**;
    - Note: **default templates are provided for each program**, so it's ready to submit as-is;
6.  Review the submission and finalize with any extra/last-minute notes or adjustments
7.  Send your submissions quickly, cleanly create folders for your clients, and ensure all clients are tracked---even if you don't immediately send to UW or know which markets to send to.
