## FAQ

#### I can't view my emails before sending or view an example of a template?

> Viewing emails or templates is currently not supported yet. For toubleshooting, feel free to set your email address as the To: address to see a working version of your current template.

#### How can I edit my signature, or the subject line?

> Currently, there are only options to edit your salutation, name, and picture of your signature(if desired); there isn't an method to access other attributes of the signature (or subject line)---such as HTML styling, the business address, disclosures or locations. While the program covers most of the essentials, in the near future as the program matures, we will be implementing more customizations to you as the user. If any special requests need to be made, contact us below under Support and we'll try to accommodate your request.
