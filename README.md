[X]  Create a GUI launcher
[X]  Load functionality into launcher & test it works
[X]  Create form field entries into launcher
[X]  Connect launcher fields to HTML email field & test they work
[X]  Create drag-n-drop functionality to auto-load quote info/details
[X]  Fix mistakes within HTML msg
[X]  Create a config file to keep some data persistent
[X]  Include html msg parts from userinput to be persistent
[X]  Connect config file to main script
[-]  Loop through each selection automatically, sending an email to each in quick succession.
[-]  Once a publishable version is satisfactorily established,  bundle pkg into .exe for usability & sharing. (Pyinstaller or Alt.)
[X]  Test .exe to ensure it works. (it doesn't loop thru each carrier currently)
